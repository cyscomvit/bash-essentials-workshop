In a Bash script, you can take input and store it in variables, and you can also store the output of commands in variables. Here's a basic example:

### Taking Input and Output as Variables in Bash Script:

#### Taking Input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for input
echo -n "Enter your name: "
read username

# Use the input in the script
echo "Hello, $username! Welcome to the Bash scripting world."
```

In this example, the `read` command is used to take input from the user and store it in the variable `username`. The user is prompted to enter their name, and the entered value is then used in the script.

#### Storing Output:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Command to get the current date
current_date=$(date)

# Display the current date
echo "Today's date is: $current_date"
```

Here, the `$(date)` syntax is used to execute the `date` command, and the output is stored in the variable `current_date`. You can replace `date` with any command that produces output, and the result will be stored in the variable.

### Combining Input and Output:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for input
echo -n "Enter your age: "
read age

# Calculate the birth year
current_year=$(date +%Y)
birth_year=$((current_year - age))

# Display the calculated birth year
echo "You were likely born in the year $birth_year."
```

This script takes the user's age as input, calculates the birth year, and then displays the result.

Remember to run these scripts in a Bash environment, either by making them executable (`chmod +x script.sh` and then `./script.sh`) or by running them directly with `bash script.sh`.
